Bryan's Django Project Template
===============================

There are many great Django project templates out there, but this is mine. I've
developed my own personal way of structring my projects and satisfying my OCD,
now I'm actually making a template to kill the repitition.

Note: All of what you see before you is extremely opinionated.

Usage
-----

    django-admin.py startproject <project name> --template=https://github.com/bryanveloso/django-project-template/zipball/master .

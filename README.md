Bryan's Django Project Template
===============================

There are many great Django project templates out there, but this is mine. I've
developed my own personal way of structuring my projects and satisfying my OCD,
now I'm actually making a template to kill the repetition.

Note: All of what you see before you is extremely opinionated.

Usage
-----

    django-admin.py startproject <project name> --template=https://github.com/bryanveloso/django-project-template/zipball/master .
